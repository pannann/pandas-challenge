# School District Analysis

This project performs an analysis of a school district's key metrics using Python and Pandas.


## School Analysis

One observable  is the impact of school type on student performance. By analyzing the data, we can observe whether charter schools or district schools tend to have higher average scores and passing rates in math and reading. This information can help in making informed decisions about school types and educational policies.

## Grade-Level Analysis

We can also observe how student performance varies across different grade levels. By analyzing math and reading scores by grade, we can identify trends such as whether students tend to improve or decline in their academic performance as they progress through school.

## Spending per Student/school and Performance

Another observable to explore is the relationship between the amount of money spent per student/school and their academic performance. We can analyze whether schools with higher per-student budgets achieve better academic results. This insight can guide budget allocation and resource allocation decisions.

## School Size, School Type and Academic Achievement

We can investigate whether the size of the school or the type impacts student achievement. Analyzing average scores and passing rates in relation to school size can provide insights into the optimal school size for promoting academic success.
